I love The Weeknd; I enjoy listening to it. Back then, I knew some of his songs like The Hills, Starboy, and a couple more, which I can't remember specifically, the popular ones everyone knows.

Unfortunately, I have never been happy about relationships with the opposite sex. My love life is a complete mess. People liked me, which I didn't want back, and the same happened vice-versa. Why am I telling this? Because it is important to understand my recent The Weeknd obsession.

Imo, people tend to listen to music that they can relate to. Yeah, a lot of people just listen for vibing and shi, but a lot of times, you need to be able to connect to the music and feel it before saying, "This one is my favorite.". With The Weeknd, that happened to me. I see myself; I see other's perspectives, like how they feel while making me sad :D. That experience made me connect to his music. But now, I'm so used to hearing his voice so even though I don't relate to the music, I still vibe hard, even though I don't do drugs and don't have a lot of girls lying on the floor.

At the time I started listening to The Weeknd, it was before Dawn FM was released. I was listening to My Dear Melancholy, and After Hours quite a lot, but my obsession started with Dawn FM... I felt so connected; the music was top of the level, I enjoyed the 90th theme, and the context was extremely relatable. I mean, I was only listening to The Weeknd at that time. Listening to albums from start to end all the time, trying old albums, etc. Then I became more obsessed because me and my friend bought tickets for Amsterdam - After Hours til Dawn Concert. We bought the tickets six months prior, and in those six months, I only listened to The Weeknd :D. And here we are, the last album is almost here. We heard a couple of new songs from his live show, and we have a studio record of "Dancing in The Flames" as its music video was shot with an iPhone 16 Pro and they used this song as an iPhone advertisement.

In this post, I will talk about how I feel about the albums, which songs are my favorites, my favorite lyrics, and probably some random stuff. It will be more detailed from starting of My Dear Melancholy. I'll also mention other albums but not in detail as others because I still didn't spend the time I did for the others. I'll just mention a Couple things and then move on. 

A little disclaimer, I'm just a basic music enjoyer, I don't know shit about music theory or anything else. The information I will give also might be incorrect so don't judge me hard, I'm just trying to spend my free time. With writing while listening music. These are my personal opinions. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my useless opinions :). 

Btw writing this while enjoying the recent [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4WgT0QOXhs&t=2457s|THE WEEKND - SÃO PAULO LIVESTREAM]], go check it out if you haven't yet.
# OG Trilogy, Kiss Land, Beauty Behind The Madness, and Starboy
Like I said, I will take a superficial look. I was planning to just skip these albums but There are some beautiful songs that I couldn't do without mentioning. 

### House Of Balloons / Glass Table Girls
Sometimes, especially when I'm walking, I like listening this one. For me, music with mode changes are most enjoyable ones. I like that change and this one is one of the best examples of that change. Even though this is not relatable as much as others for me, I still enjoy a lot with the vibe of the song.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5d6lYplVOV4xJ37EVCpHqB?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

### Kiss Land
This also has the mood change that I like. Before talking about this song, I want to refer to J. Cole's No Role Modez song here because it suits well to why I relate to this song.

>Fool me one time shame on you  
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you  
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs  
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

and ofc

>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I know I could just write one sentence and move on but I think this thing is one of the most valuable lessons that we can get about relationships, some people don't wanna be saved or it's not our job to do. We might give much more value than they gave to us, that might happen. And that's ok because we are humans, we do the same too! So, if this kind of thing happens, just know your value, don't let anyone to use or fool you.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/68Dni7IE4VyPkTOH9mRWHr?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

 Anyway, let's continue with Kiss Land. This small part is my favorite.

>God damn I'm high, my doctor told me to stop  
And he gave me something to pop  
And I mix it up with some Adderall's and I wait to get to the top  
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot  
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?

In this song, we see that Weeknd just doesn't give af. He doesn't care about what the doctor said and also the girl he mentions in the entire song. Extremely toxic behavior is everywhere. But this teaches something, if you're dealing with someone who doesn't care about you, you also shouldn't care about them. Or just make a favor to yourself and get rid of them. Sometimes we want to be with someone, help them, fix them, and save them but not everyone deserves or want's that. Know your value first, if you're not appreciated, don't appreciate either. Anyway, good song :).

### Tears in The Rain
This is a sad day song for me. We hear The Weeknd's obsession with that one girl that he talks about in Kiss Land. The girl is moved on. The Weeknd also knows this was the right thing as he says;

>You were better off<br>
You deserve real love<br>
And I deserve to be by myself<br>
We hear the words of a real toxic person. <br>

We hear him being sad about she left him, and he looks for her. Others can't satisfy him anymore.

>Now every girl I touch
They all fell the same

and

>So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

### Often

<img src="/images/bbtm.PNG" alt="Beauty Behind The Madness">

Can't relate to this song, but still wanted to mention it because it uses Nükhet Duru’s “Ben Sana Vurgunum” sample which is a Turkish song. Hearing Turkish is a unique experience for me from a weekend song.

>Seneler sürer her günüm<br>
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah  
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum<br>
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

In English:

>Every day lasts for years
Ooh yeah...
I'm tired of going alone
Ooh yeah...

### A Lonely Night

<img src="/images/starboy.PNG" alt="I'm not a mf starboy">

This is another toxic relationship song that we have. Some people have something with another to fill their loneliness temporarily. One person might feel strongly, while the other doesn't, which can lead to a short situationship. One might want something more, while the other just wants to have fun or escape their loneliness caused by someone else. This song shows that kind of situation well.

>Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us?
There's nothin' between us, oh, ay

>A lonely night  
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh  
It was the only time  
And if I led you on then I apologize, oh (oh)

At the end, he says

>Baby girl, I loved you  
Know I loved you  
Know I loved you

Which is basically BS.

### Die For You
This is one of his most popular songs, it's a great one tbh. This is one I can relate to a lot, but unfortunately, I'm the one he sings for ;). I'm a direct guy, I say I love you if I love you, and I don't talk to you I don't want you too. Holding someone as a reserve is not my thing. In this song, he says that he loves her, she is perfect, but the thing between them is not going to end well.

Girl knows this is not healthy but you can't control your feelings.

> You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry

He says

>Just know that I would die for you  
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

But imo, this is he trying to manipulate her as he admits

>I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through  
But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you  
Just don't blame me, too, yeah  
'Cause I can't take this pain forever 

He is trying to manipulate her and says

>And you won't find no one that's better  
'Cause I'm right for you, babe  
I think I'm right for you, babe

If you also had something like this or might have. Learn your lesson mate. Just don't hate that you want them, also stop it and move on.

# My Dear Melancholy

<img src="/images/mdm.PNG" alt="My Dear Melancholy,">

Ooh boy, this shit hits hard every time, whenever, wherever. He tells the story of breaking up with Selena and talks about his ex, Bella. My Dear Melancholy is not an album but an EP. I love this EP a lot, it has a special place in my heart as "Call Out My Name" is one of the songs that made me connected with The Weeknd. For My Dear Melancholy, my fav song is Call Out My Name, but also the end of I Was Never There hits hard.
### Call Out My Name
Ahh... There is too much to say about this song. Remember how I mentioned about my crappy love life? When I listened to this song with attention, It was like listening to myself. The song is about the time when Able and Selene broke up, and then he felt broken and depressed, I was living in a similar situation. I am not going to give too many details but I was inexperienced and she was someone I could easily say

> I put you on top, I put you on top

She was a long-time one-way lover of mine, a close friend that I'm so scared to mess things up. I had 0 rizz (still the same :D) with girls when I was in high school, missed a lot of opportunities, etc. Everything could be much different If I had the same vision that I have now, but it is easy to say. Things don't work in this way. These bad experiences made today's Emirhan after all, right? Anyway, it was a long time ago so I'm cool with it now, enough cool that writing a public post about it :). She treated me like I'm a sack of shit, I feel it that way at the end. It's so stupid to have feelings for someone who behaves like that, but you don't know anything, hope it will be better, see the good examples everywhere, and say why can't we like this? This is what I like about The Weeknd, I see the other side and my side at the same time. A lot more to tell, but I don't want to go deeper, it's irrelevant. Let's about the song but not my love life.

Selena and Abel broke up. The whole EP is about this event. In this song specifically, we see his depression. He wants her back; he wants to hear from her. In the beginning, he talks about how they helped each other, and how he valued her.

>I put you on top, I put you on top  
I claimed you so proud and openly  
And when times were rough, when times were rough  
I made sure I held you close to me

He wants to hear from her, he wants Selena to call him, he still loves her. He didn't accept the break-up yet.

>So call out my name (call out my name)  
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently  
I want you to stay (I want you to stay)  
I want you to stay, even though you don't want me  
Girl, why can't you wait? (why can't you wait, baby?)  
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?  
Won't you call out my name? (call out my name)  
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and  
I'll be on my

> I said I didn't feel nothing baby, but I lied 

In 2015, Gomez shared her lupus diagnosis with the world. One year later Gomez's kidneys failed. The Weeknd was going to give his liver to her.

> I almost cut a piece of myself for your life  

As Selena and Justin became together in a short time, he felt like Selena just used him till she made up her mind. He put her on top but it was not the same for Selena. In my case, a similar thing happened, and similar emotions were felt thx her.

>Guess I was just another pit stop  
'Til you made up your mind  
You just wasted my time

Even though, he still wants her.

>I want you to stay even though you don't want me

And at the end, repeats that he is up to try again.

>Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way, girl  
I'll be on my
>
>On my way, on my way  
On my way, on my way, ooh  
On my way, on my way, on my way  
On my way, on my way, on my way  
(On my)

A beautiful first song for My Dear Melancholy. Other songs will build on this.

### Try Me
This song is similar to Call Out My Name, but a little more focused on re-gaining her. I love how this song sounds. This is one of my go to songs if I just want to vibe to a song.

He's trying to reconnect with her.

>Any time is the time  
Any time for you to get my call, baby (So, baby)  
Are you alone, baby?  
If he ain't around, pick up your phone, baby

He wants her to try with him again. He mentions she is the best he ever had (in the next song he will change his mind :))

>Can you try me? Try me?  
Once you put your pride aside  
You can notify me, -fy me  
You're the best I ever had  
Baby girl, remind me, -mind me  
Let me know if it's on  
And you know where to find me, find me

He's questioning the relationship and how she moved on so quickly. 

> I didn't know you were down for him finding out  
I thought you had some kind of love for your man

He repeats that he wants to try again but in the end, he's desperate and is wondering if Selena even misses him. 

> Don't you miss me, babe?  
Don't you miss me, babe?

### Wasted Times
He looks back to his relationship with Bella and realizes that Selena was not even half of her. In this song, he starts to give up on relationships in this song. We'll be hearing this a lot later.

Abel left Bella, but after the breakup with Selena, he felt like how Bella felt.

>Wasted times I spent with someone else  
She wasn't even half of you  
Reminiscin' how you felt (-niscin' how you felt)

He questions about who Bella is with

>And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?  
Who you give that love to now?  
Who you pullin' up on?  
Who you gettin' sprung for now?  
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot

He then mentions that Bella was with him from the beginning

>These girls only want you when you're winnin' (winnin')  
But you've been with me from the beginnin' (ooh, yeah, yeah)  

He says he's done with catching feelings but is open to something that is not serious. He openly says that he wants to f with Bella without something serious.

>And I know right now that we're not talkin' (not talkin')  
I hope you know this dick is still an option  
'Cause I'll beat it up (I'll beat it up, yeah)  
I took my time to learn the way your body functions  
You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion (ride it baby)  
This sex will get you high without no other substance

>'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway  
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings (feelings)
>
Catchin' feelings  
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings  
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings  
Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee

### I Was Never There
I always loved this song as it has the mood change I love but recently, this song started to hit HARD because of a recent experience. I met with a girl and we matched quickly. We had a lot in common, I enjoyed my time with her and she did too. Then she mentioned that she had a toxic ex, and how badly he behaved to her, and I thought I could fix her (lesson taken in hard way). She was full of red flags, but her ass was bigger than the flags 😉. Joke aside, I opened my feelings early on. At the beginning, she said she was not interested in the same way, but then she started changing her mind. There were ups and downs but I was trying HARD, like never before. I was trying to get help from my friends on how to talk, what to do etc. I was giving my best shot to make her my gf. Friends that met with her liked her too, so everything went well on my side except for her having some red flags that concerned me. But in the end, red flags won. She was still on her ex's effect. Then we stopped talking all of a sudden. My best guess is she's talking with the toxic ex again. Bro cooked, notes taken :). Let's get into the song.

He is sad, thinking about taking his life, don't enjoy life anymore. Huge depression he has.

>What makes a grown man wanna cry?  
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)  
What makes him wanna take his life?  
Ah, oh (ah)  
His happiness is never real  
(Real, real, real, real)  
And mindless sex is how he feels, ooh, he feels

He feel like he was never there, meaning what Selena had about Able was fake and meaningless. He was just a pit stop to Selena.

>It was like I was never there  
It was like he was gone in thin air

>Ooh, and now I know what love is  
And I know it ain't you for sure  
You'd rather something toxic  
So, I'll poison myself again, again  
'Til I feel nothing  
In my soul (in my soul)  
I'm on the edge of something breakin'  
I feel my mind is slowly fadin'  
If I keep goin', I won't make it
If I keep goin', I won't make it
And it's all because of you  
It's all because of you  
It's all because of you  
It's all because of you

AAAHHHHHHH THIS PART... The mood changes, the sound, the message, everything is perfect. Sometimes we want someone to love us, we try to change with the though of they might accept us if we did. But this is toxic. Don't ever poison yourself for someone who wouldn't value you as much as you value them. If you do, you'll just hurt yourself and your mind might slowly fade :). At the end, he blames Selena, but blame has no affect to her. Damage is taken by only Abel.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1cKHdTo9u0ZymJdPGSh6nq?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

### Hurt You
Bella and Abel were seen in the same apartment and Abel was seen going to her apartment after the breakup with Selena. This song is a message to Bella.

He warns her that he's done with the relationship. So, she shouldn't have any expectations.

>And now I know relationship's my enemy  
So stay away from me  
I'm warning you

He knows how Bella feels because of him and how she still wants him, but he also warns her that he's not open to love.

>That all the nights you slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby)  
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby)  
And if it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste)  
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

He mentions that he's interested in the thing between her legs but not her heart.

>When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me  
Just call me up again  
I'll make you weak  
Girl, I'll come and put myself between your legs  
Not between your heart  
Can't you see?

Then he repeatedly says that he doesn't want to hurt her. So this is a clear message to Bella.

### Privilege

Finally, he moves on from the break-up and accepts it. Perfect ending for this EP. 

He's done with her. He accepted that it ended.

>Enjoy your privileged life  
'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night  
We said our last goodbyes  
So let's just try to end it with a smile

As he gave up and he was done with her, he don't wanna hear if she ever going to call for help.

>And I don't wanna hear that you are sufferin'  
You are sufferin', no more  
'Cause I held you down when you were sufferin'  
You were sufferin'

And then he gives the signals of he's going to change. We will be seeing how Abel going to change in the [[content/posts/the-weeknd-last-trilogy|last trilogy]].

>And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay  
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say  
And I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways  
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh

# Conclusion
In the end, I really enjoyed writing this because by explaining, I also made a lot of things more clear in my head. I know there are a lot of beautiful songs of his that I didn't mention, and might mention later but for now, it is what it is, these were the ones that came to my mind. Initially, I was going to also include [[the-weeknd-last-trilogy]] here, but this is already more than enough for a blog post so I decided to split them. So, have a good day, don't forget to learn from your and others mistakes. Emirhan out.
