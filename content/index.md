## About me
Hi y'all! My name is Emirhan. I'm a Computer Engineering student who is interested in distributed systems, optimization, efficiency, and low-level system programming. I'm passionate about Bitcoin and I'm an enthusiastic Rustacean ü¶Ä. I also like C, Go, and Python. Currently, as a personal project, I'm working on writing my own bytecode lox interpreter. With my friends, we're building something cool for cafes and restaurants, it's a secret for now ü§´, but I work on the backend side using Go and fiber framework.
