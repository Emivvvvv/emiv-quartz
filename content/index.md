## About me
Hi y'all! My name is Emirhan. I'm a Computer Engineering student who is interested in distributed systems, optimization, efficiency, and low-level system programming. I'm passionate about Bitcoin and I'm an enthusiastic Rustacean ü¶Ä. I also like C, Go, and Python. Currently, as a personal project, I'm working on writing my own bytecode lox interpreter. With my friends, we're building something cool for cafes and restaurants, it's a secret for now ü§´, but I work on the backend side using Go and fiber framework.

## Life Lore

I was born in a small city called Karaman, Turkey. I spent five years (ages 3 to 8) living in Madina, Saudi Arabia, where I started primary school, though I completed it back in Karaman. I began middle school in Karaman as well, but later moved to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for my final two years, finishing middle school there before returning to Karaman. I graduated from Ba≈üarƒ± Fen Lisesi with high achievement and was admitted to Yeditepe University‚Äôs Computer Science Engineering program on a full scholarship. Now, in my third year, I might finish early due to taking extra courses during semesters and summer school. I‚Äôm also pursuing a Minor in Economics. I did my Erasmus in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

During my Erasmus exchange at Hogeschool Utrecht, with my group and teachers, we published a paper titled [[https://press.um.si/index.php/ump/catalog/view/880/1284/4213|Ethnical Anthropomorphism in Human-Robot Interaction: Personalized Robot Tutors]]. As for sports, I used to cycle amateur with my road bike, but I put that aside to focus on preparing for university entrance exams. I practiced taekwondo in middle school but stopped when we moved to Jeddah. I still enjoy swimming, although I'm not a professional. I played a lot of games as a kid but have given them up recently to focus on school and personal growth. I'm a big fan of Formula 1 and a beginner in chess. Additionally, I have a passion for cars. I also really enjoy taking pictures.
