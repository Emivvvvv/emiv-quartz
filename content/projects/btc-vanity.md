A Bitcoin vanity address generator written with the Rust programming language.

With btc-vanity, you can create a private key that has a compressed Bitcoin pay address that has a custom prefix, suffix, or a string at somewhere in the address.

You can easily run the btc-vanity terminal application locally or use it as a library to create your vanity keypair securely.

## Screenshots
DO NOT USE THE PRIVATE KEYS ON THE SCREENSHOTS! NEVER EVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY! THESE ACCOUNTS ARE NOT IN USE! USING THESE ACCOUNTS MEANS YOU PROBABLY LOSE YOUR MONEY!
