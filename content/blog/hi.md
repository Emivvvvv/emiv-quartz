Today, from nowhere, I decided to have a website and create some content. Why am I doing this? I don't know. Do I need a reason to do this? No! So, I said why not and here we go.

This website is built by using [[https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz|Quartz]]. I saw Quartz while stalking random people's GitHub pages, and I liked the idea. Personally, I'm not that into frontend (I hate it). I learned but did not use it a lot and forgot everything I knew. Tbh, I don't want to know it either, so it's fine. 

For personal websites. I like it basic. Simple is enough for me. I don't need some super complex stuff on my dumbass website, a static and minimalistic one is more than enough. I had only an HTML website before, and I still like the idea. It's simple, and most importantly, it does the job. With being OK to a static website, I can host my website on GitHub Pages, and thanks to that, I don't need to put my dumbass website to a "komputer" to run my crappy `i-am-no-use-at-all.js` or `u-dont-need-me.js` javascript files.

My initial purpose was to have a CV-like website that would have a small `whoami` part and some of my projects. But when I saw Quartz, as it works well with Obsidian and the graph view looks so damn cool, I thought writing some posts in my free time and beginning to be more productive would be cool, and here we are. At 2 am, I'm writing this as a placeholder.

I am thinking of writing about topics that I especially want to grasp well and firmly. By writing the topic here in my own words, I can catch any parts that I think I understand but don't. But what I write may not only be about technical topics, I can also write about hobbies or random stuff. I am a pro [[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yapper|yapper]].

Anyway, that's it for now. Peace out! For anyone who read till the end, here is a gift for you, another pro yapper like me.
