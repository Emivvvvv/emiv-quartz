I had the pleasure of working with Emirhan during the minor Social Robotics at the HU University of Applied Sciences, and I was consistently impressed by his skills in programming and problem solving. He quickly picked up programming with the Furhat robotics robot and, without any additional help, set up a full experiment, even creating a manual for other students to use the robot effectively. His ability to learn quickly was evident from the start, as he began working hands-on with the robot in the very first week, even before practical assignments were required. He demonstrated critical thinking when contributing to a paper, particularly in the discussion section, where he reflected thoughtfully on the results. He also came up with an engaging topic for a social robotics experiment inspired by his own cultural background—a robot designed to teach people about Turkish history. Strong communication was another skill; he delivered presentations effectively throughout the course. His enthusiasm to do more was apparent from day one, showing initiative well before deadlines. Despite working with some challenging team members, he excelled in teamwork, respecting their input and maintaining harmony. Finally, Emirhan consistently met deadlines, delivering materials on time. I highly recommend him for any future opportunities.
