My favorite album all time.  IMO, this album is connected with My Dear Melancholy. This album is what happened after the sad brake up. In Privilege, he said

> And I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
 
we clearly can see that he's back to his old days. He's not happy about it though.

## Alone Again

>How, how much to light up my star again  
And rewire all my thoughts?

>Count it up, it's all for you, count it up  
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up  
'Cause I don't know if I can be alone again  
I don't know if I can be alone again (alone again)

## Heartless

I love to analyze heartless. Heartless is a super sad song when you listen to it in context with privilege and the rest of after hours. In my dear melancholy, Abel put aside his playboy attitude and was vulnerable. In privilege he says he would “drink the pain and be back to my old ways”. Then in heartless, he goes back to those old ways and has to put on this careless attitude that we’ve seen in the past.

When you listen to the song, you can tell what he is saying is mixed with uncertainty and that he doesn’t really mean it. He goes from saying he never needs a girl to then wondering what she ever saw in him in the first place. Heartless is one of my favorite songs of his because it describes the “post-break-up anger” perfectly. Initially most people are mad and spiteful towards the situation, but it usually turns into sadness rather than anger. Great song from After Hours.
